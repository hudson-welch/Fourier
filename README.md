# The Basics of Fourier Analysis
This repository has Jupyter notebooks for my Blog on the basics of Fourier analysis.  
I include a pdf version for those not interested in Jupyter Markdown or Python.  Each file goes with a post. 
I hope you find these a useful reference in your study of Fourier analysis.
